# Ringer-Timer
An Android app that helps users automate the process of changing ringer modes. Ringer modes can be changed to silent or vibrate and a timer can be binded to the task. When this timer finishes, the app sets the state of the phone ringer to whatever the user specifies while setting the timer.
